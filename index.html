            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have always lived in Colorado. I love to ski, hike, and try new places in Colorado. I am the only person from my high school to attend TCU in my graduating class, which included 755 students. I played lacrosse and field hockey growing up, and I play on the TCU women's club lacrosse team.My passions are working out every day/ staying active, playing lacrosse, and studying criminal justice.  My interests include watching true crime documentaries, spending time with friends, baking/cooking, and being with family. </p>
            <p> My short-term goals are finishing college with a 3.5 or higher cumulative GPA, studying abroad next semester, and getting an internship next summer with an agency that focuses on data analytics. My long-term goals are to work for a federal agency as an intelligence or crime analyst, moving around the country and seeing the world, and mentoring younger students to help choose their career paths. </p>
            <p>My current studies at TCU include criminal justice courses, and I am focusing on my minor in data analytics. I am also participating in an independent study with a criminal justice professor on a research project about the deaths of inmates in jails across the United States.</p>
