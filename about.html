    <p>I have always lived in Colorado. I love to ski, hike, and try new places in Colorado. I am the only person from my high school to attend TCU in my graduating class, which included 755 students. I played lacrosse and field hockey growing up, and I play on the TCU women's club lacrosse team.</p>
