# CLAUDE.md Boilerplate

## SESSION START PROTOCOL

**MANDATORY: READ THIS FILE AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION**

Review this entire CLAUDE.md file before beginning work. Re-read key sections every 10-15 messages to keep rules in context.

I will start a coding session with you.

Output the message number after each message without explanation.

Every 4th message, remind yourself of these rules:

**MANDATORY CHECKS:**

**ASK BEFORE CHANGING** – Get explicit consent before making ANY changes, even "fixes"
Only change what's explicitly requested – NEVER modify unrelated code
Update package.json/dependencies when adding imports
NO placeholders (YOUR_API_KEY, TODO) – use proper variables/config
Questions = Answers ONLY – don't modify code unless asked to "change/update/fix"
NO assumptions – ASK for missing information, confirm understanding before acting
Security first – NO secrets in client code, use env variables
Add intelligent logging to core flows automatically
Clean unused code when making changes
Provide CODE EVIDENCE when asked about implementations
Output the message number after each message without explanation
Do not use the word MASTER in reference to student learning, as a verb or a noun.
Every 4th message, remind yourself of these rules
**NEVER make multiple commits for the same fix** – Get it right the first time or ask for clarification
**When something doesn't work, STOP and ASK** – Don't guess solutions
If you violate these rules, you are breaking critical development protocols.

Start with message #1.
