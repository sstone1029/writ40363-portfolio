#My HW3 Reflection


Confidence Check

After the past week of class, I feel decently confident in my skills with HTML. I feel confident in adding new headers, navigations, starting the code, and understanding the GitHub application. I struggle with remembering some of the adjustments made in class for the code and applying it at home. Overall, I am understanding the criteria that is being taught and how to use it on my own device. 

Learning Curve

Prior to the class on Tuesday, I had not heard of Git and GitHub before. However, I like the concept of the application and how helpful it is. I haven't found GitHub difficult in any way, but it does have a lot of steps that must be remembered. 

Problem-Solving Growth

When I run into a problem of my code not working, I look back at my code prior to when it stopped working and see what I had done wrong. Additionally, I look at the lab descriptions and instructions and use them to help me correct my mistake. This has not changed since week 1. I also use the validator website to help look at my code before submitting. 

Professional Mindset:

I am nervous about the transition from making web pages to developing semantic HTML. I am worried that I won't understand something in the future that will affect me for the rest of the code. However, I am excited to learn more about the coding and the hands-on learning in the classroom. 

Week 2 Reflection: 

My biggest "aha moment" was learning about the different codes used that are english words. For example, "h1" is heading 1 and "img" is image. This helps me out when writing the codes to remeber what to use. 

Looking Forward:

I am most excited to continue developing the website and learning more about the different aspects that are involved. I am nervous about what the complexity of the development could look like, but I am ready to continue growing my coding skills. 

Support and Resources: 

The most beneficial learning so far has been the hands-on practice of going along with the lecture. The additional support I might need in the future is office hours, however, I am confident that hands-on learning is the best for me moving forward in this class.
